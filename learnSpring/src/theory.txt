step 1 -> Follow learnSpring.game
Initially we were making separate file for configuration but as of now we are making same file as
configuration file by using annotation @configuration
and component scan will scan whole beans of given path package

When you call context.getBean(GamingConsole.class), you are asking Spring to provide a bean that matches the GamingConsole interface.
Since GamingConsole is an interface, Spring will look for a class that:
Implements the GamingConsole interface.
Is annotated with @Component (or a similar stereotype annotation) to be registered as a bean in the Spring context.
How Spring Resolves the Bean:-->
Interface Lookup: You request a bean by its interface (GamingConsole.class), so Spring will try to find a bean whose class implements this interface.

Component Scan: During the component scan (because of @ComponentScan("com.spring.learnSpring.game")), Spring will have registered any class in that
package that implements GamingConsole and is annotated with @Component.

Bean Injection: Spring will return the appropriate implementation of the GamingConsole interface.

Note --> @Qualifier is used during dependency injection, not for getBean().
Note --> Yes, that's correct! By default, the name of a bean in Spring is derived
         from the class name of the annotated class with the first letter converted to lowercase.

step 2 --> Follow examples folder
Look in this step basically we have talked different way of injections and annotations that can be used to
do dependency injection like constructor injection , field injection , getter and setter injection
when we have more than one interface implementations then we can use qualifier for injections
in examples till c1 is only these

Scope of beans -->
1. Normal --> spring will give same instance
2. Proto  --> spring will give new instance everytime

PostConstructor and PreDestroy -->
follow f1

cdi annotations -->
look component is generic for beans but but but for specific beans we have cdi annotations

xml Configuration -->
initially people were using xml configuration for writing beans like as of now we are just using annotation but earlier people were in one file
follow h1
